# Flask Data Retrieval and Processing Application

## Overview

This Flask application simulates a simplified version of a data retrieval and processing system. It provides the following features:

1. An API endpoint `/fetch-data` to simulate fetching data from an external service and processing it.
2. A function to process the fetched data (e.g., converting text to uppercase and doubling numerical values).
3. Temporary in-memory storage for the processed data.
4. An API endpoint `/get-processed-data` to retrieve the processed data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd flask_app
